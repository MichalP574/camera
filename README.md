This work is devoted to present vision system development and examination for contactless measurements of inverted pendulum angles. The reason for exploring this field of science is the wide versatility of optical systems in application. Such a solution also presents a lot of advantages over other methods. The main benefit is a negligibly small influence on objectsâ€™ properties (the centre of gravity, mass moment of inertia, etc.).
